This is another simple full stack project I have made. I DID leave out the function to 'view_student', it's redundant due to 'view_all_students' and how the students are being posted to the page.

I do not have the intention of polishing this project yet. I'm going to keep churning out these small projects until I can build them quickly and with ease. 

In this project you can add students to the database, change their grade and change their age. It's just a simple student manager.
